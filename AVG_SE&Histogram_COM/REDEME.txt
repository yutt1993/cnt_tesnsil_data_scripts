10.249.24.254:/home/amax/taotao/L100-------------------100 sample data locations of linear chain structure
10.249.24.250:/home/amax/taotao/z100-------------------100 sample data locations of zigzag chain structure
10.249.24.255:/home/amax/taotao/H100-------------------100 sample data locations of single helix chain structure

There are three files in the three directories above:
h.py-------------------Histogram data processing and drawing program
AVG_SE.py--------------Mean and error band data processing and plotting program
main_AVG_SE.py---------Call the main function of AVG_SE.py
main_h.py--------------Call the main function of h.py

Finally, export the merged data to the local machine to draw the average error band graph and histogram of the three structures.

The programs and files used are in the following directoriesï¼š
